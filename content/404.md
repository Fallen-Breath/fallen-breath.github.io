## Navigation Update For My Blog

{{< mydiv "blog_jump">}}

Set your compasses, folks! On 2023/6/22, I altered the course of [my blog](https://blog.fallenbreath.me). 
Take a look at the url format change:

- From: `https://fallenbreath.me/$year/$month/$day/$title`
- To: `https://blog.fallenbreath.me/$lang/$year/$title`

No treasures lost, they're just stashed under a different X on the map. Happy navigating!
